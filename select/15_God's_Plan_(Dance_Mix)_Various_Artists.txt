You so fucking precious when you smile
Hit it from the back and drive you wild

So tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spent the night
Underneath the sunrise
So tell me where your love lies

Baby girl, what your name
Let me talk to ya
Let me buy you a drink
I'm T-pain, you know me
Konvict music,nappy music,ooh wee

I spy with my little eye
A girlie i can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie i can turn into my wife
Wait,that means forever,ever,hold up,never mind,yeah

What goes around,goes around,goes around
Goes all the way back around

We found love right where we are

She said do you love me
I told her only partly
I only love ma bed and ma mama
Am sorry

Say my name,say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby i love you
If you ain't running games
Say my name,say my name
You are acting kind of shady
Ain't calling me baby

Gold jewellery shining so bright
Strawberry champagne all night
Lucky for you that's what i like,that's what i like
Lucky for you that's what i like,that's what i like

You are way too beautiful girl
That's why it will never work
They have you suicidal,suicidal
When they say it over

You in the friendzone now
Sorry but there is no way out

Damn, my AP going psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all jewellery on you

You only need the light when it burning low
Only need the sun when it start to snow

Yeah, i'm on one
I said,I'm on one

Buddy you are a boy make a big noise
Playing in the street going to be a big man someday

Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things,things don't run we
Don't take things from nobody,yeah yeah

Gods plan
Gods plan
Yeah yeah
